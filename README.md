# PDF to Audio Converter

This Python script converts the text from a PDF file into an audio file (MP3 format). It uses `PyPDF2` to extract text from the PDF, `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert the text into speech, and `Tkinter` to select the PDF file through a simple graphical interface.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. A file dialog will appearâ€”select the PDF file you want to convert.
3. The script processes the PDF and generates an MP3 file with the same name as the PDF in the same directory.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 gTTS tqdm tkinter
